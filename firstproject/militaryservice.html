   My grandfather is a WW2 veteran. Flemmon joined the military straight out of high school and served in tge army for 2 years as tool keeper. After he left the army he tries to find new job, so applies for army again. The recuiters asked if he was married and said yes, so couldn't take him. Takes his papers and walks across the room to the air force recuitment table, applies and leaves for March Air Force Base the next morning.
