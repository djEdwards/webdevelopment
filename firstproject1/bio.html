   Flemmon Cox is my grandfather. He currently lives in Los Angles, California and has been living there for over 30 years. He has served in the air force for 20 years and has fought in WW2. He is currently retired at the young age of 92. In his freetime which is mostly all the time he likes plays golf and voluenteer at his local church often.
