<h1>1948-----------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
<p>Harry Snyder introduces California’s first drive-thru hamburger stand in a space barely 10 feet square at Francisquito and Garvey in Baldwin Park. Every day before dawn, Harry visits the meat and produce markets to pick out fresh ingredients, which he prepares by hand. Meanwhile, his wife Esther diligently takes care of all the accounting for the new restaurant at their home right around the corner.</p>

<h1>1954-----------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
<p>The iconic In-N-Out arrow makes its first appearance, replacing the original “No Delay” sign. Inspired by their new logo, In-N-Out associates adopt the sayings, “The arrow points to pride” and "We all work under the same arrow."</p>

<h1>1979-----------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
<p>A new era begins when restaurant #21 in Ontario becomes In-N-Out’s first single drive-lane location. After this only 13 more restaurants were built without a dining room. Future restaurants now will also offer large, open and comfortable dining areas where customers can sit down to enjoy their burgers.</p>

<h1>1990-----------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
<p>On November 10, Gilroy, California becomes home to the 100th In-N-Out restaurant when the doors open at 641 Leavesley Road. At this time, California and Nevada remain the only states with In-N-Out locations.</p>

<h1>2013-----------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
<p>In-N-Out Burger celebrates its 65th anniversary and has 286 restaurants in five states: California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Texas. After 65 years, Harry and Esther's philosophy of providing fresh food and friendly service continues to be the cornerstone on which the company stands.
